I also have a seat in the council of the International Association of Hydrogeologists' Belgian chapter.\nI live in the beautiful Haspengouw region, am a proud father of two and husband to an amazing wife. When not playing (retro/voxel games, i.a.) with my kids or practising asanas, I love being creative in the art space.\nYou can find some links here to things I'm doing out in the open. I love feedback on any of these, so do not hesitate to reach out!\n\n\ndf <- arrow::open_dataset(“projects”) |> dplyr::collect() df |> dplyr::filter(class == \"science\") |> dplyr::pull(name)\n\n\n[1] \"RMODFLOW\" \"RMT3DMS\" \"mnemosyne\" \"cv\"\n\n\ndf |> subset(class == \"art\") |> with(name)\n\n\n[1] \"espresso\" \"greetings\" \"weekly\"\n\n\ndf$name[is.na(df$class)]\n\n\n[1] \"rui\" \"spectralscale\""
