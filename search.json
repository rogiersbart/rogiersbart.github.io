My current interests are mainly in physics-based probabilistic programming, procedural solid texture synthesis, and empowering people with R.\nI live in the beautiful Haspengouw region, am a proud father of two and husband to an amazing wife. When not playing retro or voxel games with our kids, reading them stories about Middle-Earth, or practising asanas and taegeuk, I love being creative in the art space.\nYou can find some links here to things I'm doing out in the open. I love feedback on any of these, so do not hesitate to reach out!\n\n\ndf <- arrow::open_dataset(\"projects\") |> dplyr::collect() df |> dplyr::filter(class == \"#rstats\") |> dplyr::pull(name)\n\n\n[1] \"morphology\" \"ra\" \"ti\" \"std\" \"rui\" \"spectralscale\" \"nmhsa\" \"RMODFLOW\" \"RMT3DMS\" \"bro\"\n\n\ndf |> subset(class == \"art\") |> with(name)\n\n\n[1] \"espresso\" \"greetings\" \"weekly\"\n\n\ndf$name[is.na(df$class)]\n\n\n[1] \"cv\" \"dotfiles\" \"rogiersbart.github.io\""
